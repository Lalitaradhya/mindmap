But the state government has its social responsibility. So this offering of compensation and job offers is part of the state government's responsibility. This is required so that the victims\u2019 families do not have to depend on others for their survival in the future,\u201d she said.Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister claimed that the situation in North Bengal worsened because of the release of water from neighbouring Bhutan and claimed that the flood situation in North Bengal is a \u201cman-made\u201d disaster.According to her, while the water released from the dams of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) was responsible for the flood situation in South Bengal, the same action in Bhutan created the crisis in North Bengal.The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, ridiculed the Chief Minister and claimed that the usual blame-game from the Chief Minister has continued even after the disaster in North Bengal.\u201cWhile she blames DVC for the situation in South Bengal, she blames Bhutan for the crisis in North Bengal. The Chief Minister does not understand what should be the priority of the state government, and that is why she always resorts to the blame game. At times her target is DVA and at times it is Bhutan,\u201d the Leader of Opposition claimed.(This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.
