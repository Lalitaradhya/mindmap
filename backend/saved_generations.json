Key government initiatives include the Indradhanush plan for PSB revival, recapitalization of banks, and financial inclusion/digital-payment schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and the broader digital-banking ecosystem (UPI/NEFT/RTGS) under Digital India.",

Constitutionally, defence and external affairs are Union subjects; boundary negotiations are carried out by the central executive with Parliament\u2019s oversight for international agreements (via Article 253 and related provisions), while final delimitation remains a bilateral matter rather than a judicial determination. In the Indian context, these issues impinge on sovereignty, national security, border infrastructure, defence planning, and diplomacy, with broader implications for regional stability and domestic politics. UPSC-focused dimensions include the historical evolution of the boundary, the nature of the LAC and disputed zones, key flashpoints, and the institutional framework (WMCC, Senior Commanders\u2019 Talks, Border Personnel Meetings) plus CBMs and agreements (1993/1996 CBMs, 2013 BDCA), along with government schemes such as BRO for border infrastructure and BADP for border-area development.",
